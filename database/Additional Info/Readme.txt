1. Run the create tables file

2. Run the default inserts file (this will add the default tables value's status, categories, etc.

3.

Default Users:

Username: TestFaculty ------- Faculty

Username: TestBusiness  ------- BusPartner

Username: TestAdmin -------- Sign in with this account to access all functions/see all options (also an employee)

Password: Password123

The admin is the only one who can add new user accounts & add new members to the database, etc.

4. I use indexes, not text for most of my table commands/parses/etc. 
Refer to the excel file for value translations.
